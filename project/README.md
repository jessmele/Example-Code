Project Folder
This folder contains the following documents:
mele_jessica_project.ipynb
mele_jessica_project.pdf

The pdf version is fully compiled with Python code and Markdown cells 
illustrating my project on using K-Means Clustering to cluster 
the NLP dataset 20 News Groups.

Datasets were imported from SciKit-Learn and modules, methods and objects
from SciKit-Learn were used to implement the methods described in the project.

If you need to run the .ipynb file it should compile completely although 
it takes at least 10 minutes to run to completion on my machine.

Thank you!
